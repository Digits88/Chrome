# Chrome Demo

The chrome demo suffers from slightly antiquated design due to lack of update to its http://www.appdesignvault.com/shop/chrome/[source application]. The original demo was based on an iOS native template designed during the iOS 4.x days and the template was never updated to modern flat design heuristics. 
 
We still think this demo is of interest so we chose to keep it and modernize it, the original version was written on top of the old GUI builder. This version is adapted to the new GUI builder. We removed a lot of the textures and old icons from the design and replaced some of the fonts with the new fonts + material design icons. 

You can try the native demo on an Android device [here](https://www.codenameone.com/demos-Chrome.html) and also check out the live [in browser version of the demo](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/Chrome/). The latter uses the [Codename One JavaScript port](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/javascript-port.html) to build the unmodified demo into a web app.
